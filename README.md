Heyo, I'm Chrys. I linger around ponytown sometimes, but not that often.

I don't mind if you C+H me, especially if we're friends, you just got to sit next to me yourself or invite me to C+H; I only automatically sit with close Discord friends.

I'm an OSDD system, but you can just refer to me as Chrys unless I open up about who's fronting.

I like Coroika, Jet Set Radio, and there's other stuff if you feel like checking my rentries.

I got two sides; Jet Set Radio OST and the GOODNIGHT HYPNOPOMP (album) by Stomach Book. Like if I was music, I'd be JSR/JSRF OST and Stomach Book's discography.

I kin Shady from Coroika and Wanderer from Genshin Impact the most. Also I'm puppetkin, I'm a haunted puppet.

I've got C-PTSD and AuDHD. I can struggle a bit with social anxiety and paranoia since I'm an overthinker too, but that's about it. I might have narcissistic traits and borderline traits, but I think it stems from my C-PTSD and not so much from a possible personality disorder.

Pls int if you also like Coroika or Jet Set Radio, I might be offtab sometimes tho so whisper to grab my attention.

Dni if darkship or radqueer, or at least don't talk to me about that stuff if you wanna int cuz it makes me uncomfortable.

I'm sorry in advance if I struggle to interact much, I don't always know what to talk about and I don't like randomly infodumping my interests unless permitted (=,=;)
