Heyo, I'm Chrys. I linger around ponytown sometimes, but not that often.

I don't mind C+H, especially with friends, but I only C+H if invited to sit with someone or if you're one of my close Discord friends.

I'm an OSDD system, but you can just refer to me as Chrys unless I open up about who's fronting.

I like Coroika, Jet Set Radio, and there's other stuff if you feel like checking my rentries.

I kin Shady from Coroika and Wanderer from Genshin Impact the most. Also I'm puppetkin, I'm a haunted puppet.

I've got C-PTSD and AuDHD. I can struggle a bit with social anxiety and paranoia since I'm an overthinker too, but that's about it. I might have narcissistic traits and borderline traits, but I think it stems from my C-PTSD and not so much from a possible personality disorder.

Pls int if you also like Coroika or Jet Set Radio, I might be offtab sometimes tho so whisper to grab my attention.

Dni if darkship or radqueer, or at least don't talk to me about that stuff if you wanna int cuz it makes me uncomfortable.

I'm sorry in advance if I struggle to interact much, I don't always know what to talk about and I don't like randomly infodumping my interests unless permitted (=,=;)
